## Comand-Line tools for linguists  
    
 This course provides you with information that is useful for using computer when researching like making your own corpus and how to use the remote server.  

### Module 1

 In this module, we saw how to set a unix system and basic unix command

 **_Main learnt commands_**  
   * cd  This means change directry
   * wget  You can use it to get file from web
   * less  This allows us to check a file in another tub
   * nano  open a text editor

 Frankly speaking, I have more difficulty in setting ubuntu than learning commands. A subttle difference of version would cause serious problem. To detect and solve the problems was the most bothering. 


### Molude 2

 In this section, we learnt text prosessing, structured text file, a command that combines two command.

 **_Main learnt commands_**  
  
| command        | function     | field of work  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| sort      | reoder the data in alphabetical order | prosessing |
| sed      | replace specific words with another      |  prosessing and structuring  |
| pipecommand  | use the output as an imput of another command | command to combine |

 The most useful one I learnt is sort. I use corpus for my research, so I think it will help me to make my own corpus. 


### Module 3

 In this part, we used bash scripts, modified configuraton, became a root user and istalled package.

 **_Main learnt commands_**  
   * sudo  This is to get a temporary root 
   * chmod  This is to change the permission
   * ./  This is used to run a bash script

 I do not have a confident about writing and understanding the bash script... chmod was difficult for me at first because I cannot imagine what a certain file having a permission means. 


### Module 4

 In this week, we tried connecting to remote server and running remote resourses

**_Main learnt commands_**
   * scp  we can send and get  files between our computer and remote server
   * git add  send a file or dir to a work place
   * git commit   save the progress in the local 
   * git push  save the progress online and share with others 

 I can understand the system of github and where should I be careful. Actually, it took 4 hours to solve the conflict when retrying revert after I had entered a wrong hash. In the first repository, which is not the one I submitted, I could not find the resolution. And after deleted the repository and tried again from zero, I found that we should stop the prosess with wrong hash by using --abort.


### Final Week


 We are trying to make our own web page using a text editor.  
 Jekyll enables us to see the web page we are making and is useful when github have not been ready to show.
 Githubpages is good when you would like to make a clone that is located in another person's github.

 I learnt how to copy the website from github pages and install jekyll.

I am not sure what image I should put, so I put cute cat photo.
